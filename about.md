I have engineering background, former ESCOM, ~~looking forward getting a MSc. degree and who knows, maybe a PhD. (who doesn't like being called Doctor, haha!)~~, now working as a devOps specialist and software developer on [redacted] company. Not getting rid of the idea of an even higher degree of studies, but now I want to see how far i can get with only my knowledge as a tool (and coffee).  

Always looking to learn stuff, it doesnt matter if it's math, a new programming language or a cooking recipe (yum!).  

I'm a huge coffee enthusiast who happens to love lists, so lets make a new one about other things I like:  

* AI (beware of those sneaky bots!)
* Python (hell yeah!)
* LaTeX (MS word sucks big time)
* Linux
  * Gnome
  * Fedora
* Lisp
* Did I mention [coffee](https://xavrb.github.io/misBebidas-starbucks/)?
* Online privacy
  * Telegram (those secret chats are cool, huh?)
  * Wickr
  * ~~ Wire~~
  * Signal
* Markdown, obviously!

So thats about the size of it. I've been tech-inactive for a while but I'm back!

Remember guys, use [Telegram](https://telegram.org/dl) and TeX.
