As of July 2023 Ive been preparing myself and improving my tech skills -- specifically I'm learning about Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats). Below is a list of the courses in Coursera, Platzi, Udemy, etc:


* [Getting Started with Elasticsearch on Google Cloud](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/99ZZ52574QUV)
* [Using Elastic Stack to Monitor Google Cloud](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/5JL49TX47QGS)

Some time ago I earned a certificate on basic ELK from Platzi:
* [Curso de Introducci√≥n a Elasticsearch](https://platzi.com/p/javiermejiaperez/curso/1912-intro-elasticsearch/diploma/detalle/)


Soon I'll add some more courses either on ELK or other cloud technologies as Jenkins and Kubernetes.

Peace!
